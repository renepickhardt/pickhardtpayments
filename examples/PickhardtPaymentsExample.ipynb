    "# Pickhardt Payments Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Example code demonstrating how to use the `pickhardtpayments` package in python. You need to install the library via `pip install pickhardtpayments` or you can download the full source code at https://ln.rene-pickhardt.de or a copy from github at: https://www.github.com/renepickhardt/pickhardtpayments\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you can use the classes in the library to create your own async payment loop or you could exchange the Oracle to talk to the actual Lightning network by wrapping against your favourite node implementation and exposing the the `send_onion` call. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example assumes a randomly generated Oracle to conduct payments in a simulated way. For this you will need an actual channelgraph which you can get for example with `lightning-cli listchannels > listchannels20220412.json`\n",
    "\n",
