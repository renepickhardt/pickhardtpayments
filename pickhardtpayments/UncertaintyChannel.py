    The channel class contains basic information of a channel that will be used to create the
    UncertaintyNetwork.

    Since we optimize for reliability via a probability estimate for liquidity that is based
    on the capacity of the channel the class contains the `capacity` as seen in the funding tx output.

    As we also optimize for fees and want to be able to compute the fees of a flow the classe
    contains information for the feerate (`ppm`) and the base_fee (`base`). 

    Most importantly the class stores our belief about the liquidity information of a channel.
    This is done by reducing the uncertainty interval from [0,`capacity`] to 
    [`min_liquidity`, `max_liquidity`].
    Additionally we need to know how many sats we currently have allocated via outstanding onions
    to the channel which is stored in `inflight`.

    The most important API call is the `get_piecewise_linearized_costs` function that computes the
    pieceweise linearized cost for a channel rising from uncertainty as well as routing fees.
